## Starting from Scratch

- Start with a feature, not a layout
- Detail comes later
  - In the earliest stages of designing a new feature, it’s important that you don’t
get hung up making low-level decisions about things like typefaces,
shadows, icons, etc.
- Don’t design too much
- Color
  - <span style={{color:"#3b82f6"}}>Blue</span> is safe and familiar — nobody ever complains about blue
  - <span style={{color:"#FFD700"}}>Gold</span> might say “expensive” and “sophisticated”
    - sophisticated: 复杂的，高级的，有品位的
  - <span style={{color:"#ec4899"}}>Pink</span> is a bit more fun, and not so serious:
- Border radius
  - A small border radius is pretty neutral, and doesn’t really communicate much of a personality on its own
  - A large border radius starts to feel more playful
  - No border radius at all feels a lot more serious or formal

- Limit your choices( **我理解的tailwind在做的事情** )
  - Define systems in advance
  - Designing by process of elimination
  - Systematize everything
